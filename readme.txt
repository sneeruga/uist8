**Clearly document each modification you made and how you believe it will impact the overall accessibility of the page. If, in the process of completing this assignment, you found any pre-existing accessibility problems with the page, please document those as well.

When starting the assignment we found that there were already some accessibility problems. The format of the website was not the most intuitive to begin with. The logo was too large and was not able to be navigated through using the tab button. The webpage was also did not use responsive design. We looked at all the different disabilities and based on those we decided what could be changed for the worst. We made a list of all the changes we needed to make so that the website would be very anti-accessible. The list as follows:

-Add low contrast colors (red and black) or (red/orange/yellow/green)
- Edit type to be hard to read by using Serif type
- Make fonts smaller to read for visually impaired people
- Make links similar to the description they follow so it is hard to see the difference between the two
- Take coloring out of links of schools in the middle section of the site so they do not look clickable
- Email address box should be changed to something ambiguous to “enter”
- Go to the top button at the footer should be removed
- All links in the footer should be removed so it is harder to find shortcuts for visually impaired and motor impaired
- Hero banner picture should be changed to something that uses different colors which would be hard to see by colorblind people
- Move text closer (kerning) together so they are hard to read
- Change the title in the HTML to “Web Page” so if visually impaired have multiple tabs the screen reader will say ambiguously, “web page”
- The links on the right side should read “more” instead of read more 


**A brief description of your design process. How did you determine what modifications to make? What accessibility tools, if any, did you use? Include a reflection on how this exercise did (or did not) help you better appreciate issues of accessibility in design.
A description of the work breakdown among team members, and documentation of any 3rd party software, resources or inspirations used in your project.

We used Apple’s accessibility tools to test our site. We used Voiceover to see if the website could be read through by a visually impaired person and it was found not to be intuitive at all as we tried to navigate the site. Although no one on our team is colorblind, we found that the site was very hard to read through because of the colors we chose for the site and the type used. For motor impaired people we tried to use one finger to navigate through the site and found it extremely difficult to go through the site.
This exercise was definitely harder than we thought it would be. Our team found that making the site more accessible might have been an easier task than making it worse. We realized this was the case because it was difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of people with the different kinds of disabilities we learned about in class. It was definitely eye opening as we thought in their perspectives and points of views and used the tools they use everyday to use websites and other screen based technologies. We used the tools they use like screen readers to navigate through and found it to be enlightening.

Our team did equal work in making the website an unaccessible nightmare. We each completed one half of the tasks from the list above. We took inspiration from early 90’s and 2000’s websites from the web.
